Three weeks later, they made it all the way to Elkhorn, muscling through the Goblin Gate and the Grand Canyon of the Elwha, to the river's headwaters at the feet of Mount Olympus. More blasting planned this year to take out one last rock pile at the former Glines Canyon Dam site is expected to help more chinook reach the upper river."

These stack up and jam, creating a braided river channel  as the river flows around them. Fish hide  in the  shady cover of the logs and lurk  in  plunge pools dug by the river  pouring over the  logs. The  river also is creating new  side channels fish use for spawning and rearing – a good thing because some of the old side channels filled in with sediment released by  dam removal. "

They cache seeds that sprout, leave manure that feeds new ground, and in their forays feed the animals that eat them."

It's such a dynamic environment.\""
