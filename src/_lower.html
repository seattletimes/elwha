    The lower river was the only place available to salmon, once Elwha Dam was built five miles from the river mouth without fish passage in 1910.  Entrepreneur Thomas Aldwell built Elwha Dam to generate hydropower to attract industry to the city of Port Angeles. Cheap hydropower helped jump start the economy on the Olympic Peninsula. But anadromous fish populations in the Elwha declined by 98 percent overall during the last century.

    <h4>AFTER DAM REMOVAL: EAGLE FEEDING FRENZY</h4>
    <p>The riverâ€™s winters are alive with more eagles in the lower river than anyone can remember in decades, with 50 to 60 of the elegant birds feasting on eulachon. Also called candlefish, these fish, listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act, are enjoying a population boom. Lamprey, another prized native fish, are also in the river again. These fish could be strays from elsewhere in the Salish Sea, checking out the Elwha.

    <h4>DIPPERS are FLOURISHING</h4>
    <p>Scientists studying American dipper, our only native aquatic songbird, have learned that with the return of salmon to the river the birds are bigger, and hatching two rounds of young a year. They also are more likely to stick around, instead of migrating. Samples of their feathers, blood and toenails show why: a boost of nutrients from salmon returned to the river. Surveys show otters are fattening up too.

    <h4>RIVER BOTTOM INVERTEBRATES HAMMERED</h4>
    <p>Scientists monitoring invertebrates in the river bottom documented a near total population crash as sediment smothered the lower river once the dams came down. These tiny animals at the base of the food chain including caddis flies, stone flies and mayflies are starting to recover now that the sediment pulse is passed.
