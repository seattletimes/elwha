The Elwha watershed is booming with new life, just three years after the world's largest dam removal anywhere. 

Elk stroll where their used to be reservoirs. Bigger fatter birds are bearing more young, and moving in to stay. A young forest is growing where three years ago, there was blowing sand. Even the water is alive, with seeds tumbling down the river's coursing current.

At a gathering of scientists at the Nature Bridge campus at Olympic National Park recently to assess all aspects of Elwha dam removal, experts shared astonishment at how rapidly the watershed is changing. 

"Big things can happen if people persevere," said Mike McHenry, biologist with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, which got the ball rolling on dam removal when it was still thought a crazy idea. "Back in 1990, you ask somebody in Anywhere, USA about dam removal," McHenry said, "They would have told you that you were nuts."

Not anymore. Washington, still one of the most hydropower-rich states in the nation, is also today the world's dam busting pioneer. 

PacifiCorp did the math on keeping the Condit Dam on the White Salmon River in Southwestern Washington and blew it up with one blast on October 28, 2011.  

It took an act of Congress in 1992 to finally free the Elwha, dammed for a century. The first concrete went flying in September, 2011. Elwha Dam was out by March, 2012. Glines Canyon Dam tumbled for good in September, 2014. 

The big idea in all three cases was to get rid of deadbeat dams no longer worth their maintenance and repairâ€“ and which also had no fish passage, as environmental laws require. The $350 million Elwha experiment remains the biggest dam removal project ever anywhere. With three quarters of the Elwha watershed permanently protected in Olympic National Park, it offered a unique chance to start over.  

It's as if the whole watershed was waiting.
