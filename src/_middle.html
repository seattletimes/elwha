    The middle  river  was the  realm between  the upper  dam, Glines  Canyon, and Elwha Dam, the lower  of the two at 108 ten feet tall. No ocean-going fish lived here between the two dams for more than a century. Animals that feed on those fish were starved for nutrients from salmon. The river lacked the structure of gravel, sediment, and big wood that an un-dammed river would have conveyed from the upper watershed and its banks.

    <h4>NEW LOG JAMS CREATE PRIME FISH REAL ESTATE</h4>
    <p>What used to be Lake Aldwell is a now a broad flood plain the river winds through, carrying logs  and gnawing trees from its banks  as it goes. These stack up and jam, creating a braided river channel  as the river flows around them. Fish hide  in the  shady cover of the logs and lurk  in  plunge pools dug by the river  pouring over the  logs. The  river also is creating new  side channels fish use for spawning and rearing – a good thing because some of the old side channels filled in with sediment released by  dam removal.

    <h4>BACK AND BUSY: SALMON</h4>
    <p>The middle Elwha and its tributaries went from no Coho at all before dam removal, to producing about 32,000 outgoing salmon fry in 2014. Chinook redd counts are up more than 350 percent and steelhead 300 percent from 2013 to 2015. Even sockeye have been spotted in Indian Creek, perhaps from landlocked Kokanee in Lake Sutherland, that have rediscovered their ability to go to sea.

    <h4>BEAVER are ENGINEERING A COMEBACK</h4>
    <p>The reservoirs have drained away, exposing 330 acres of exposed silt, sand and gravel of the former Lake Aldwell, and about 400 acres at the former Lake Mills. Tracks of animals are often seen as animals return where their used to be lakes, including beaver, now back in both areas. They’ve got plenty to chew on: a new forest is rising in the fine sediments along the former lake shores, with alder, willow and cottonwood grown more than 8 feet high.

    <h4>VISITING THEIR WINTER RANGE: ELK</h4>
    <p>Roosevelt elk are visiting both former lakebeds. Biologists are a little surprised – and relieved that elk are browsing but not devouring more than 260,000 plantings including tasty woody shrubs put in the lakebeds as part of a seven year revegetation plan to crowd out weeds.  They seem to particularly fancy Nootka rose, big leaf maple and bitter cherry.
